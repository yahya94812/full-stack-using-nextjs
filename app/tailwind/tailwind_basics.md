**Tailwind CSS Basics Guide**

I've created an interactive HTML page that demonstrates the essential Tailwind CSS utilities! This guide covers:

**Core Categories:**
- **Spacing** - padding (p-), margin (m-), and directional variants
- **Typography** - text sizes, font weights, alignment, and styles
- **Colors** - background and text colors with common shades
- **Flexbox** - flex containers, justify-content, align-items
- **Grid** - grid layouts with responsive columns
- **Borders & Rounded** - border styles and border-radius
- **Width & Height** - sizing utilities including responsive widths
- **Shadow & Opacity** - box shadows and transparency
- **Buttons** - practical button examples with hover states
- **Hover & Transitions** - interactive states and animations
- **Responsive Design** - breakpoint modifiers (md:, lg:)
- **Display & Position** - block, inline, hidden, absolute positioning

Each section includes visual examples that demonstrate how the classes work, making it easy to understand and reference. The page itself is fully responsive and uses many of these utilities in practice!
