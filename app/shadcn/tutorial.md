## setup
* npx shadcn@latest init

## usage
* npx shadcn@latest add button
* import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
* use <Button>Click me</Button> in your component

* Actually, you can add any component using the command:
npx shadcn@latest add <component-name>.
This will install the required dependencies (i.e., reusable components). After that, you can copy the code for that block component from shadcn/ui and use it in your project.
* Each block component is built using multiple smaller components, so you can easily customize it according to your needs.
